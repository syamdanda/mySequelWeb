What is MySequel Web
=================

MySequel Web is an open source web based GUI tool to access your MySql/Postgresql database.
It is similar to PHP My Admin of WAMP. Here you can access any MySql/Postgresql database with proper connection strings.
We do not save or store any of your connection strings or data. Every thing related to your connection strings are volatile. You can host this as a simple nodeJs application on any server or you can simply run this in your local.

Demo
=================
You can access https://mysqlweb.herokuapp.com/ for live demo. <br/>
To run the application in your machine, Run the app.js file from your cmd prompt<br />
     
     mySequelWeb>node app.js
Then navigate to http://localhost:1234 url by opening your favorite browser.<br /><br />
